# 3-Days

A nurse, Claire,  has been recently assigned a new patient named Edward.  Her new patient seems to be struggling with more than just his illness - something seems to be troubling him. Taking on the role of Claire, see how your choices will affect the relationship of an ailing father and his distant daughter.
